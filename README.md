<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<h4>Home & Personal Energy Efficiency<br>
•        Smart Home & Energy Automation<br>
•        Energy-efficient Appliances & Gadgets<br>
•        Monitoring household consumption to reduce wastage<br></h4>
<h3>Solution </h3>
Home Energy Management and Power Efficiency System.<br>
It works on the basis of the collected data from the IoT device and user input, then it uses the ML models to predict Energy consumption.<br>
We have also made Simulator for Predicting the expense and money saved while buying a product for the home, we have also made a simulation for Solar Energy power.<br>
Best feature it shows you in how much time you can get back your invested money and after that we will only have profit.
